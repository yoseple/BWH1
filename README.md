Project Overview:

A pipeline where you can upload a CT scan in NIfTI format (nii.gz file), which then segments the lower lumbar region of the scan. This process includes the segmentation of the disks within the scan. Following segmentation, 
the file undergoes a conversion from nii.gz to .obj format. The result can then be viewed in a 3D plane using the Three.js Model Viewer. With this pipeline, you have the option to either download the .obj file or view it using
Three.js.

How it works:
Using the Verse Dataset which has all the
